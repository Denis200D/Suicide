<p>Has the strongest impact on others, can definitely kill you, and it can also burn your name into the history books. However, the pain is also the most intense and the death is miserable. There are many cases where people with 100% skin burns did not die immediately and were sent to the hospital, where they struggled for a long time before dying. The consequences of not dying are more tragic than any other means of suicide. For those who want to die an ordinary death, I will never advise them to adopt this method. However, if you want to accuse this society of something with your death, there is no way more dramatic than self-immolation. Thích Quảng Đức, the Vietnamese monk who protested the government in the Vietnam War, the students who recently committed suicide for the anti-government movement in South Korea,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#korea-immolation" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> and the cadre of the Kamagasaki Joint Struggle Committee in Japan who fought to improve the treatment of the grassroots working class,<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#kamagasaki" id="id2" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>2<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> they all committed suicide by self-immolation and caught the attention of society. Yes, the image of being surrounded by flames and shouting his opinions is very influential.</p>
<p>There is nothing better than using self-immolation to express strong will and determination to die. The seven female believers who committed mass suicide following the late leader of the “Friends of Truth”<a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#friends-of-truth" id="id3" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>3<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a> in 1986 also committed suicide by setting themselves on fire.</p>
<p>Some people may think that not too many people commit suicide by self-immolation, but the number is increasing every year. Currently, there are about 700 people a year, which is much more than committing suicide by electrocution. According to current medical diagnosis standards, one-third of all suicides are considered to be mentally ill in the “narrow sense”, and the majority of those who attempt self-immolation are considered to be mentally ill.</p>
<section id="preparation-five-liters-should-be-enough">
<h2>Preparation: Five liters should be enough<a class="headerlink" href="#preparation-five-liters-should-be-enough" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>Needless to say, this method requires gasoline or kerosene, but how many liters?</p>
<p>Burning 20% ​​of the skin on the whole body would already be a lot for the body to take, but in order to die for certain, the only way is to pour gasoline all over the body. Although there are examples of using two or three liters of kerosene to completely burn off the skin, for the sake of safety, it is better to prepare at least five liters.</p>
<p>Gasoline and kerosene can be poured on little by little, and the clothes would soak in to be fully flammable. If kerosene gets into your eyes, it will be very painful and you will be unable to open them. However, if you would be bothered by this consideration, you are definitely not the kind of person who can commit suicide by self-immolation.</p>
<p>If you are afraid of starting a fire, you can put down a flame-retardant carpet so that even if you lie down and burn indoors, it will not cause a fire. There was also a 48-year-old housewife who doused her in gasoline and went inside an incinerator, but this was totally unnecessary, and only became good gossip material for <em>Women’s Weekly</em> magazine.</p>
<p>After dousing yourself with gasoline, you can use a lighter or a match to light the fire of destiny. Anyone planning to make a statement should have it firmly in mind beforehand, lest they panic and forget it all.</p>
<p>There are also many people who pour gasoline indoors and burn the entire house down. But this method is strictly worse than the others. If you are going to suffer the extreme agony of burning to death, you should let people see that it is you who are burning. Having others see you burn is the entire point of self-immolation.</p>

<h2>The process: A three-meter-high pillar of fire emerges<a class="headerlink" href="#the-process-a-three-meter-high-pillar-of-fire-emerges" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The flames is much stronger than one imagines. Once gasoline or kerosene is ignited, it will make a sound and suddenly burst into flames two to three meters high. The body shrouded in flames will experience severe pain and burning sensation, and will roll on the ground because it is unbearable. There will be a stink of burning human flesh all around. But generally the perception is still clear. The trachea was burned due to inhalation of hot air, but the sound could still come out. After the clothes were completely burned, the fire was extinguished, but some people could still stand there on their own and continue to shout (Case study 24).</p>
<p>After the fire is out, if more than one-third of the skin is necrotic, nearly half of the people will die. If more than two-thirds of the skin is necrotic, almost all people will die without exception. The time of death varies. If the skin of the whole body is burned as black as charcoal, the person will die on the spot. After the fire is extinguished, they will be taken to the hospital in an ambulance. The body cannot move, so they will greet the arrival of death in pain. . Some finally breathed their last after half a day or one day, or even five or ten days. An 82-year-old American woman who set herself on fire while shouting “against the Vietnam War” lived consciously for ten days. Her problem was probably caused by alcohol-based detergent that didn’t burn well.</p>
<p>Causes of death caused by self-immolation include shock, hypoxia, and thermal coagulation of vital organs.</p>

<h2>Corpse appearance: The skin was torn and bloody<a class="headerlink" href="#corpse-appearance-the-skin-was-torn-and-bloody" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The corpse would be in a miserable condition, second only to suicide by lying on the railway.</p>
<p>Pouring more than five liters of gasoline and lighting it on fire. When no one puts out the fire, part or all of the skin surface will be carbonized and all the hair will be burned out. The skin peeled off, revealing red flesh. Originally, the human body is basically made of water, so even if the skin is carbonized, the meat is difficult to burn. The characteristic of this posture is that it becomes a boxing posture due to muscle contraction. Blisters appear on the skin that has not yet become necrotic, and the color changes from yellow to brown, and finally to black. The corneas are white and turbid, and the tongue is often stuck out.</p>

<h2>Note: Don’t fall into the keloidal hell<a class="headerlink" href="#note-don-t-fall-into-the-keloidal-hell" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>The most terrifying thing is to leave a life behind, but continue to live with burn marks on the face or body.</p>
<p>A woman poured kerosene all over her body and lit a match but failed to commit suicide. After three years of living in a hospital bed, her body was covered with keloids. Even though she underwent five plastic surgeries, the keloids were not eliminated. She had no lips and could not open her mouth wide. Moreover, compared with other methods, where people who have attempted suicide would attempt again, self-immolation suicide attempters typically do not attempt suicide again. The may be because they have recovered from the near-Ugliness by using extreme methods and have gained emotional balance. Still, the skin transplantation will cost a huge amount of money. In order not to get to this point, pour at least five liters of gasoline. If someone comes to put out the fire, shout: “Don’t come close!” Even so, if you are still worried about the attempt, you can use it together with other methods.</p>
<p>A man killed a woman who cheated on him (24 years old, ran to the top of the tenth floor of his alma mater university, doused himself with gasoline and jumped off the building. However, there is absolutely no need to try this hard. Self-immolation is already a very lethal method.</p>
<p>All in all, self-immolation is painful. But remember, death won’t happen immediately. Everyone has their own preferred method of death. If one wants to die quietly, I would suggest another method. However, if you think you have lived as a nobody but want to die as somebody, then that’s up to you.</p>

<h2>Case study 24: Korean youth who set himself on fire to demand better working conditions<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-24-korean-youth-who-set-himself-on-fire-to-demand-better-working-conditions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>In November 1970, Jeon Tae-il (전태일), a young tailor (then 22 years old) who was working under poor working conditions, set himself on fire in Seoul Peace Market (서울평화시장; Seoul Pyeonghwa Sijang), demanding better working conditions.</p>
<p>Before that, he had been engaged in a movement to improve labor conditions, but suffered setbacks. Finally, on November 3, he forcibly launched a demonstration – which he applied for, but could not get permission for – in the Seoul Peace Market. When the workers were participating in the demonstration, the guards, and the police When there was a fierce conflict between the troops, he appeared in the market later than his companions and asked his companions to “light a match and throw it at me.” When the match was thrown on him, his whole body immediately became a pillar of fire, then a ball of fire. He breathed the flames and squeezed into the crowd, shouting: “Abide by the Basic Labor Law! We are not machines! Give me back my Sunday! Oppose the cruel driving of workers!”, and finally fell down with a scream. But he stood up with difficulty and shouted: “Don’t let me die in vain!”. His eyes and nose were burned and blurred. He fell unconscious and his companions put out the fire three minutes later. After being sent to the medical center, he muttered: “I’m a little hungry!” Nine hours later, at around 10 o’clock in the evening, he died.</p>
<p>His suicide by self-immolation was later named the “Manifesto of Humanity”, which is still circulated today.</p>

<p>Although the fire was extinguished three minutes after losing consciousness, and he died from severe burns nine hours later, it was possible to scream continuously, and as long as he had the strength to fall down once, he could still stand up and shout. Of course, it varies from person to person. When he turned into a ball of fire, though he stumbled around due to the heat, he was otherwise very conscious.</p>
<p>This can be said to be the most effective example of self-immolation and suicide. His suicide did have a great effect, and it fulfilled his wish for him who died.</p>

<h2>Case study 25: A middle school girl who burned herself because of incest<a class="headerlink" href="#case-study-25-a-middle-school-girl-who-burned-herself-because-of-incest" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>A twelve-year-old middle school girl committed suicide by setting herself on fire in the yard of her uncle’s house.
Her parents divorced shortly after she was born and she lost her mother. She was raised by her grandmother. Due to her father’s work, she transferred to elementary school and middle school twice. She grew up in a very complicated family environment. The reason her parents divorced was because her mother had a sexual relationship with her uncle.</p>
<p>However, the reasons that prompted her to commit suicide were more complicated. She also had sexual relations with her grandfather and father. She had always been troubled by this, and she was still in her first year of middle school at the time, and she began to miss school for a long time two months before the summer vacation. Finally, one day just after noon, she went to the backyard of her uncle’s house, which was the cause of her parents’ divorce, poured gasoline all over her body, and committed suicide by setting herself on fire.</p>
<p>She often played volleyball in school and gave the impression of an ordinary student.</p>

<h3>Check: the cause of death<a class="headerlink" href="#id4" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>A shocking example of a twelve-year-old girl setting herself on fire, but the first thing to note is the place of death. Her hatred for her uncle may be quite large, so going to her uncle’s backyard to turn into a fireball is also very effective in arousing her desire for revenge. It is even more surprising that a twelve-year-old girl has sexual relations with her grandfather and father. It is so terrible! She herself probably felt that committing suicide to vent her fear, resentment, and despair required a conspicuous method, not methods such as jumping off a building or crashing into a car. In this case, self-immolation is most appropriate. However, she was absent from school for two months before the summer vacation. That means she only went to school in April and May. So what happened when she transferred schools twice during this period? From the source material, I still can’t figure it out, could there be a more complicated hidden secret!?</p>

<p>In 1991, there was a two-month-long democracy protest that began with the death of Kang Kyung-dae, who was killed by a police officer on April 26th. The struggle ended during a siege at Myeongdong Cathedral on June 29th. Several protestors committing self-immolation in protest against the Roh Tae-woo regime.</p>

<p>Funamoto Shuji (船本洲治), far-left revolutionary, labor activist, and member of the Kamagasaki Joint Struggle Committee (釜ヶ崎共闘会議). In 1975, he set himself on fire in front of Kadena U.S. Military Base in Okinawa. His final words: “I’ve attempted to assassinate the crown prince but, given the situation, this has become objectively impossible. Therefore, I’ll protest not with a struggle risking death but with my own death. Comrades in Sanya and Kamagasaki! Do not die on the streets silently! The future belongs to the proletarian multitude, the final victory belongs to the workers who struggle. Go forward with certainty!”</p>
<p>The Kamagasaki Joint Struggle Committee was a member of the All-Campus Joint Struggle Committees (Japanese: 全学共闘会議; Zengaku kyōtō kaigi), commonly known as the Zenkyōtō (Japanese: 全共闘). It was a collection of Japanese student organizations consisting of anti-government, anti-Japanese Communist Party leftist and non-sectarian radicals. The Zenkyōtō were formed to organize students during the 1968–69 Japanese university protests. Unlike other student movement organizations, graduate students and young teachers were allowed to participate.</p>

<p>The church is named “真理の友教会”. The church was founded in 1950 by Seiji Miyamoto, and in 1976 moved to a location near the Hamanomiya coast where the incident occurred. There, some believers lived in a group with Miyamoto. At the time of Miyamoto’s death, there were approximately 80 to 120 believers.</p>
<p>The corpses were found on 1986-10-31 on a beach in Wakayama prefecture. Nearby was a plastic container of kerosene, which police surmised the woman used to immolate themselves.</p>
<p>The church was headquartered about 500 meters away from where their bodies were found. They ranged in age from 25 to 67, included the wife of the cult leader, and by some accounts were each related by blood to her.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The seven women were Nobuyo Miyamoto, aged 42; Tomoyo Ka- waguchi, 67; Yumiko Yamamoto, 35; Yasuko Matsuo, 28; Kimiyo Ochiai, 37; Midori Tsuji, 35; and Noriko Miyamoto, 25. Nobuyo Miyamoto was the wife of Seiji Miyamoto, 62, who had been the leader of a local religious cult, Mzchz-no-torno Kyokaz (the Friend of the Truth Church).</p>
<p>Believers demonstrated re- spect for the leader by addressing him as “the Spirit of the Truth or “the Teacher”. His teaching consisted of fortune-telling, consulting about miscellaneous problems of daily living, and preaching “the true way of life”. The Friend of the Truth Church is a local cult that combines elements of Christianity and Buddhism. The members of the church believe in Jehovah, the Almighty; however, there is a statue of Kannon, the Buddhist goddess of mercy, in the church. Its simplistic and mundane belief is that, if one leads an honest life and cleanses the spirit, one can ask for relief in heaven after one’s death. The believers did not even read the Bible. They never solicited donations or expanded their doctrine aggressively. They accepted those who came voluntarily, but never tried to persuade neighbors to join them.</p>
<p>Thirteen suicide notes were found in Miyamoto’s house addressed to the women’s families. Several of the suicide notes had been written about 3 years previously; these read, “If our Teacher dies, I wish to accompany him to heaven. I wish from the bottom of my heart that those who live after our Teacher’s death will keep his teachings and let the world know them.” It is reported that there was no order or coercion from either the leader or some church members for the women to kill themselves after the leader’s death, and that the mass suicide took place of the women’s own free will. Other members of the church remained eerily calm and serene, and accepted the mass suicide as a natural consequence. One of them said, “The Teacher died. They must have followed him, because the real relief exists only in heaven.”</p>
